I am currently working as a Full Professor, Doctoral Supervisor at the School of Remote Sensing and Information Engineering, Wuhan University. 

I received the prestigious "the 1000 talents plan for young talents" award and Hubei Province Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists. In addition, I am also a "Chutian Scholar" distinguished Professor in Hubei Province. 

In the past 11 years, I have worked as a postdoctoral fellow, research Fellow and independent PI at the National University of Singapore. 

In terms of scientific research projects, I was responsible for 5 Singapore national projects and 1 international cooperative project. As the sub-team leader, I participated in 5 Singapore national projects and 1 international cooperative project, and obtained 1 intellectual property transfer (70% share). I participated in a number of China Natural Science Foundation and 973 projects during my master’s and doctor’s degrees. 

In terms of academic papers, I have published 68 academic papers, including 25 SCI papers, which have been published in IJCV, IEEE PAMI, ISPRS JPRS, IEEE TGRS, IEEE ITS and other top journals. 

In terms of talent cultivation, I have supervised 6 doctoral students, 2 post-doctoral students, 13 master students, and 55 interns and exchange students. 

In terms of academic posts, I served as the editorial board of two journals. Editor of three international conferences, member of the Procedural committee and chairman of sub-forums; As a reviewer of 28 SCI journals including IEEE TIP, ISPRS JPRS, IEEETSP, CVIU, etc.
